# Specifity on CSS

Rules can affect the same elements, when this happens we have to verify the speficifity of selectors. This means, there are selectors with a higher "priority" than others and will affect the elements at the very end of the rendering.

## In order we have

* Inline Styles
* #ID selectors
* .class, :pseudo-class and [attribute] selectors
* Tag and ::pseudo-element selectors
* Inheritance
